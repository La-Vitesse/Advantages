Advantages of La-Vyf Protocol for borrowers and lenders.

Safeguarding the parameters of the La-Vyf contracts, the Protocol ensures the loans are paid back quickly â€“ in the same transaction in which they are taken out.

Arbitrageurs can turn a quick profit by borrowing funds; buying low on one market; selling high on the other market; repaying the loan; and pocketing the profit. This can be done within the same on-chain transaction, since the markets are DEXs often running on ethereum.

The fee for both borrowers and lenders is decided algorithmically:

For borrowers, it depends on the cost of money - the amount of funds available in the liquidity vault at a specific time.
For lenders, this interest rate corresponds to the earn rate, with the La-Vyf Protocol safeguarding a liquidity reserve to guarantee withdrawals at any time.

As funds are borrowed from the liquidity vault, the amount of funds available decreases which raises the interest rate. In a nutshell, La-Vyf Protocol operates nearly risk-free. Since the ethereum network settles transactions automatically, the borrower who cannot pay back the loan with his trade loses nothing, the lender will still have the asset deposited under La-Vyf contract in the liquidity vault.
